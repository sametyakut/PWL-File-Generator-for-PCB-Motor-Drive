# PWL-File-Generator-with-MATLAB

This MATLAB script aims to generate PWL file which contains varying duty cycle. This will help to fasten and ease the Spice simulations. Note that this code is specifically written for PCB motor drive setup in METU Powerlab. However, adjusting parameters will help you to use this code for creating PWL files of varying duty cycles for any kind of PWM application.
